Task-01: Business Sales Dashboard from E-commerce Data

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive e-commerce dataset to derive actionable business insights. The primary goal is to identify best-selling products, uncover sales trends, and pinpoint high-revenue categories. The final deliverable is a dynamic and interactive dashboard built in Power BI designed for business stakeholders to explore data and make informed decisions.

ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies Power BI Desktop: Used for data modeling, transformation, and creating visualizations. Power Query: Used for all ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, including data cleaning and preparation. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating custom measures and calculated columns to derive key business metrics. ðŸ”„ Project Workflow The project followed a systematic approach from raw data to a finished dashboard:

Data Loading & Cleaning:

Combined multiple raw data files (for different years) into a single master table using Append Queries. Corrected data types for key columns like OrderDate, Quantity, and PriceEach. Handled missing values and removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy. Data Transformation & Enrichment:

Created new columns in Power Query to enrich the dataset. The most important was a Revenue column calculated as [Quantity] * [PriceEach]. Extracted date components (Year, Month, Quarter) from the OrderDate to enable time-based analysis. Data Modeling:

Designed a star schema data model by separating the data into a central fact table (sales_data) and multiple dimension tables (Customers, Products, Orders, etc.). Established one-to-many relationships between the dimension tables and the fact table to enable powerful filtering and data slicing. DAX Calculations:

Created a dedicated _Measures table to store all calculations. Developed key DAX measures for core KPIs, including: Total Revenue Total Orders Total Quantity Sold Time intelligence measures like Year-over-Year Growth. Dashboard Design & Visualization:

Built an interactive dashboard with a variety of visuals: Cards for displaying high-level KPIs. Line charts to visualize sales trends over time. Bar charts and Treemaps to identify top-performing products and categories. Maps for geographical sales analysis. Slicers to allow for dynamic filtering by year, country, and product line.
